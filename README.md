# Resume Optimizer - Web Interface

I have built this AI workflow to help me apply for jobs in a more efficient manner. I've been taking some courses on implementing LLMs within my code and thought this could be a cool way to help A) learn more B) help my job search. Although simple, it has helped me fine-tune my resume in respect to the job description that I am applying for. It utilizes a very simple flask app for input. Feel free to change the model and prompt. I am currently using gpt-4o-mini.


## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Add your API Key in `.env` file:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and replace with your actual API key
   ```
   - Get your API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart)
   - **‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER commit your .env file to GitHub!**

3. **Start the web server:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
